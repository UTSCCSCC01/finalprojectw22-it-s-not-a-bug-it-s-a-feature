Unfinished tasks:
the abiity to watch a vod 


Practices:

What we should keep:

The frequent calls and meetings so everyone is up do date with what they have to do
focused groups for frontend and backend so everyone has to only focus on one area as opposed to multiple


What we should try:

to use jira more frequently and make more sub tasks
Use jira throughout the sprint and not just at the end, so we get a better burndown chart
better communication so everyone is up to date with what they have to do


What we should stop:

Lack of communication between the sub-groups  and disogranization among team members


Experiences:

Our Worst Experience
trying to juggle work while having a lot due so close to the end of the semester
Being behind on our progress in comparison to the other groups 
Leaving everything to the end 
Not following through with Jira tasks
