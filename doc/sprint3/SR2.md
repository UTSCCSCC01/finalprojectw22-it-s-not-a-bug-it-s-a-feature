Unfinished tasks:
Live-stream feature 
Vod needs to be uploaded to the database and not stored locally
More pages need to be developed in the front end 


Practices:

What we should keep:

We should keep the groups so everyone only has one area they need to be focused on 


What we should try:

Create sub tasks 
Use jira throughout the sprint and not just at the end, so we get a better burndown chart


What we should stop:

Lack of communication between the sub-groups 

Experiences:

Our Worst Experience
Being behind on our progress in comparison to the other groups 
Leaving everything to the end 
Not following through with Jira tasks
