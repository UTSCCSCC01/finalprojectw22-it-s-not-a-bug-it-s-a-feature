The two giants of streaming and online entertainment as of now are YouTube and Twitch. It should be mentioned that there are in fact other platforms (such as TikTok and Instagram) but due to them being side features of a different service, they will not be direct competition to our product. 

Both Twitch and YouTube in the past have indeed implemented their attempts at creating a social-media functionality for their product. However, due to bad design, lack of support, and failure to recognize their audience, these attempts have either failed or been left unused. 

We seek to create a streaming platform with a direct focus on enabling content creators and fans to interact and communicate all in one complete package. This means that users can enjoy watching content from their favorite streamer on the same platform as their main social media outlet. With the continuously shortening attention span of the average person, having all of that functionality in one place not only benefits the user but the added AD revenue from keeping the customer on our platform for longer benefits the investors.

Currently, most content creators resort to platforms such as Twitter and Instagram to connect with their fans as there are no better alternatives in YouTube or Twitch. With our product, they can enjoy interacting with fans or the other direction all in one convenient location on the web. 

This also is beneficial to parents. A major genre in streaming is "Gaming" which attracts a very young, influenceable audience. With our platforms, parents can worry no longer about their children being exposed to harmful and inappropriate content on other social media platforms and the children can safely browse our website with a "parental control" feature turned on. 

This dual functionality has long been overlooked as the giants of steaming are enjoying their monopolized market and thus they see no reason in improving their already very profitable product.
