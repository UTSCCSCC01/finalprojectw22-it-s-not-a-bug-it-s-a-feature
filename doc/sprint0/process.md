Process:

How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?

We used Discord/Zoom to organize the logistical side of things. Meetings and discussions were held 
in the discord chat and voice channels. Separate text channels were made for further organization 
for our discussions. For example, the channel “availability” was used to discuss when team members 
could meet. Github was used to organize our code and project files and Jira for our user stories.

How did you make decisions?

We made our major decisions through our planned meetings. Team members would suggest ideas and 
others would provide feedback and build upon the idea until a consensus was achieved. Minor 
decisions were up to the individual; however, others were free to suggest changes if something 
was overlooked.

How frequently did you meet?

Early in the sprint we would meet once every 2-3 days. As we approached the sprint deadline 
we would meet everyday.

What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?
We learned that it's important to choose convenient meeting times for all group members to 
accommodate people in different time zones and to avoid interfering with classes/practicals.

Another important lesson going forward is that we shouldn't shy away from at least considering 
certain features just because we don't know how to implement them yet.
