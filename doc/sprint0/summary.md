Objective: 
To build a streaming platform that includes a built-in social media which allows more effective and convinient communication and interaction between streamers and their community, without the need to leave the platform. The built-in social media would have both posting and direct messaging functionalities.

Key Users:
The platform serves mainly gaming enthusiast viewers, whether they are teens, young adults or adults, as well as content creators who wants to build a great community.

Key usage scenarios:
1. Tim loves watching others play his favourite video game. Not only did he learn a lot from the content creators, but he also likes to discuss the game with other viewers as people around him in real life don't really love video games as he does. Recently he discovered streaming and is absolutely loving it, especially that now he can participate in discussions live as the streamer progresses through the game. However, he is upset that there is no way he can continue in the discussion after the stream ends.

2. Byler is an aspiring streamer who put great effort trying to build a awesome community of viewers and like-minded content creaters. However, he grows frustrated as he needs to switch to a social media platform everytime he wants to communicate with his community, and it is always hard to convince others to join that social media group. He is looking for another streaming platform where he would not need to worry about using a separate social media. He'd like to post interesting stuffs in his channel and talk freely to his community after stream ends, and his every viewer of his can send direct message to give him suggestions on future contents.

Key Principles:
To generate a sense of community for the streamer and their fans, without sacrifising user safety.
Ensure high-average standard streaming/watching experience.
