Purpose: This site is created as an ease of access to content creators and consumers and allowing them to communicate with each other easier. The content creators (streamers) are able to create links to their social media pages and make updates through their posts. The content consumers (watchers) can find their favorite and suitable content and communicate with each other through streams. The platform also allows the streamers and the watchers to communicate with each other through stream chat as well. This is created as a streaming site but with a built-in social media platform. Our objective is to build a streaming platform that includes a built-in social media which allows more effective and convenient communication and interaction between streamers and their community, without the need to leave the platform. The built-in social media would have both posting and direct messaging functionalities.
